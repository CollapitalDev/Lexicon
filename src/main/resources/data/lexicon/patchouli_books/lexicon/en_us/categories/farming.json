  "description": "Here you can find out everything about farming. $(br2)Farms can be classified as manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. $(br2)$(li)Manual farms rely mostly or solely on the $(thing)Player$() to harvest and restart the farm. $(br2)$(li)Semi-automatic farms use mechanisms to automatically harvest the farm, but they are manually activated by the $(thing)Player$(). $(br2)$(li)Fully automatic farms do not rely on the $(thing)Player$() at all and usually use $(thing)Mobs$() or more complicated mechanisms.",
